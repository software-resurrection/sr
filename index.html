      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Reading computer program code and documentation written by
        others is, we are told, one of the best ways to learn the art of
        writing intelligible and maintainable code and documentation. The
        software resurrection exercise, introduced
        in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05052">this paper</a>
        (<a href="data/software-resurrection-paper-latest-version">pdf</a>), requires
        a motivated learner to compile and test a historical release (e.g. 20
        years old) version of a well maintained and widely adopted open source
        software on a modern hardware and software platform. This exercise
        concludes by writing a critique based on issues encountered while
        compiling and testing a historical software release on a hardware and
        software platform that could not have been foreseen at the time of
        release. The learner is also required to fix the issues as a part of
        the software resurrection exercise. The exercise of resurrecting a
        historical software allows motivated learners to experience the pain
        and joy of software maintenance which is essential for understanding
        the factors that contribute to intelligibility and maintainability of
        program code and documentation. The concept of software resurrection
        exercise is illustrated using a version of the SQLite database engine
        that was released 20 years ago. This illustration shows that software
        engineering principles (or programming pearls) emerge when a
        historical software release is adapted to run successfully on a modern
        platform. The software resurrection exercise also has the potential to
        lay foundations for a lifelong willingness to explore and learn from
        existing program code.</p>

        <figcaption>Software resurrection exercise begins with
          compilation of an old release of a well maintained and widely used
          software in a modern hardware and software platform. After
          successful compilation, the software's functionality is verified
          using automated suite of tests included with the release. Learning
          opportunities are provided by failure in compilation and testing
          processes. Learners engage with the program code and documentation
          to develop a fix for these issues. Finally, the exercise concludes
          by writing a critique of the software code and documentation which
          provides the opportunity to reflect on the experiences of
          compiling and testing the software in a modern
          platform.</figcaption>

      <h2>Examples of Software Resurrection Exercise</h2>
      <p>Here are some examples of software resurrection exercise
        carried out on some well maintained and widely adopted open
        source software tools with a long history.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="exercise/sqlite/2.2.1/index.html">Resurrection of SQLite database engine released in the year 2002</a>.</li>
        <li>Ressurection of PostgreSQL database released in the year 2002 (<i>coming soon</i>)</li>
      </ul>
