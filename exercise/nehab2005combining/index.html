      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>This tutorial reports the software resurrection exercise
        on the <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/NehEtAl05/">software code</a> released as a part of the
        following research paper in Computer Graphics.</p>
      <p>Nehab et al. "<i>Efficiently combining positions and normals for precise 3D
          geometry</i>." ACM Transactions on Graphics (2005) [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073226">doi</a>].</p>

      <p>Nehab et al. (2005) describe a method to combine information
        from two different sources in order to recover a more detailed
        geometry (i.e. 3D shape) of an object. A stereo triangulation
        method can capture 3D geometry of an object and represent it
        using triangular meshes. A photometric stereo method can
        capture the surface normal at each point represented by a
        pixel in an image. These two methods capture different types
        of detail about the 3D geometry of an object. The stereo
        triangulation method captures overall shape of an object but
        is unable to accurately capture fine details (i.e. high
        frequency details). The photometric stereo method can capture
        fine details about the geometry but is unable to capture depth
        information accurately. The insight of Nehab et al. (2005) was
        to combine these two sources of information in order to
        recover a more detailed and accurate 3D geometry of an object
        that contains finer
        details. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1073204.1073226">research
          paper</a> provides a more accurate and detailed description of
        the method.</p>

      <p>I read this paper during
        my <a href="https://abhishekdutta.org/msc.html">MSc</a> and
        wondered how do people come up with such wonderful ideas. What
        amazed me was that Nehab et al. (2005) went a step further by
        releasing the program code, documentation and sample data
        required to reproduce the results reported in their research
        paper. As a research student, these assets allowed me to
        explore the proposed method in more detail and develop an
        understanding of their method in a way that I can never
        forget. This was in the year 2009-2010 at the University of
        York (UK). In 2022, I was invited to give a talk at the
        Vision, Graphics and Learning (VGL) group at the Department of
        Computer Science in the University of York. To demonstrate the
        concept of software resurrection, I chose the program code
        released with Nehab et al. (2005) because the audience will be
        able to connect with this software.</p>

      <p>The software resurrection exercise for Nehab et al. (2005) is
        described below. We use the following hardware and software
        environment for software resurrection exercise of
        sqlite-2002.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/NehEtAl05/mesh_opt.tar.gz">source
          code</a> is downloaded and extracted. A readme.txt file is
        missing but the <code>cc</code> file extension suggests that
        this is a C++ source code. The <code>mesh_opt.cc</code> source
        file is compiled using the <code>g++</code> compiler which
        reveals the first compilation error.</p>

        of <code>cholmod</code> library is manually found and the
        compiler is instructed to locate the missing library from this
        custom location. As the <code>cholmod</code> library get
        successfully located, another dependency library

          of trimesh2 library notifies of this breaking change as
          follows.</p>
        <pre class="output">
Changes version 2.11 → 2.12:

Major user-visible change: the library and headers are now contained
within the trimesh namespace. Existing code must be updated to refer
to the TriMesh class and associated functions with an explicit
namespace qualifier, or include the following declaration

using namespace trimesh;
          </pre>
        <p>This breaking change in the trimesh library can be
          addressed by appending the following statement to
          the <code>mesh_opt.cc</code> source code which instructs the
          compiler to automatically use the <code>trimesh</code> name
          for all references to the <code>Trimesh</code> data

      <p>Fixing Issue 2.1 reveals other two issues with

      <h2>3. Test</h2>
      <p>Nehab et al. (2005) have not included a self-contained
      and automated test to verify the functionality of
      the <code>mesh_opt</code> executable program. This would have
      allowed us to verify that the program is operating as was
      expected by the developers during its release in the year
        2005.</p>
      <p>The authors have included detailed <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/NehEtAl05/reference.html">documentation</a> about

      <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/NehEtAl05/samples.tar.gz">samples</a>

      <p>Apart from the execution time differences, the following
        differences exists between the obtained output and expected

        shows "Removing faces... 480 faces removed" while our output
        shows "Removing faces... 479 faces removed". This suggests that
        the <code>mesh_opt</code> program is behaving in slightly
        different ways than what was observed by the authors in
        2005. The generated output mesh looks visually similar as shown
        below. However, it is not possible to confirm this as the
        processed results (i.e. <code>optimized.ply</code>) are not
        included in the provided dataset.</p>

      <h2>4. Critique</h2>
      <p>The compilation and testing (i.e. manual comparison of
        output) of code released by Nehab et al. (2005) provided some
        valuable insights into the factors that contribute to the
        intelligibility and maintainability of a research software.</p>

      <h3>4.1 To Depend or Not to Depend is a profound question that the
        wise can answer.</h3>
      <p>The C++ code of Nehab et al. (2005) depends on the following
        two libraries:
        (a) <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/trimesh2/">trimesh2</a>
        and
        (b) <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/cholmod/">CHOLMOD</a>.</p>

      <p>The <code>trimesh2</code> library is still being maintained (last release
        was in 2020) and therefore its compilation is straightforward after
        its dependency (i.e. freeglut library) was installed using the
        operating system's package manager. The <code>trimesh2</code> library
        introduced a breaking change in 2013 (i.e. in release version
        2-2.12) which moved all the library assets to
        the <code>trimesh</code> namespace in order to avoid naming
        conflicts with other libraries or user code. This breaking
        change required a minor update to the source code of Nehab et
        al. (2005).</p>

      <p>The original CHOLMOD library has now been integrated with
        other linear algebra libraries in
        the <a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">SuiteSparse</a>
        and therefore resolving this dependency required some
        significant effort.</p>

      <p>I first tried to compile this code in 2009 during my MSc and
        I don't recall facing any major issues during the
        compilation. My colleague, who was doing his PhD during that
        time, also had compiled this code successfully in his machine
        and used it for his doctoral research. So, I know that this
        research code compiled without much friction in 2009. However,
        when I re-compiled this research code in 2022, I faced many
        issues. Most of these issues were related to the changes in
        dependency libraries. These issues have also been faced by
        others. The <a href="https://github.com/waps101/MergePositionNormals">waps101/MergePositionNormals</a>
        project created a MATLAB implementation of the research code
        from Nehab et al. because the original C-language based
        implementation had become "<i>more difficult to compile over the
        years due to required dependencies</i>".</p>

      <p>I do not know if there was a way, in 2005, to ship a research
        code like Nehab et al. (2005) that could have prevented dependency
        issues after 17 years. I will revisit this question in future
        when I gain a better understanding of the state of software
        packaging and distribution in the year 2005.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Don't rely on compilers to always be nice to you.</h3>
      <p>Compiler tolerate certain programming practices for various
        reasons. For example, the following statement exists in the
        source code of Nehab et al. (2005).</p>
      <h4>File: mesh_opt.cc</h4>
      <pre class="code">
...
const std::vector<int> &g = mesh->grid;
...
const vector<int> &af = mesh->adjacentfaces[v];
...
      </pre>
      <p>The existence of the statement <code>const
          vector&lt;int&gt; ...</code> indicates that the authors must have
        missed to include the <code>std::</code> namespace prefix
        because other similar declarations does include the required
        prefix <code>std::vector</code>. This code must have compiled
        successfully in 2005; possibly with a compiler warning
        message. In the year 2022, compilers generate an error, instead
        of a warning, thereby requiring an update to the source
        code.</p>
      <p>Compiler warnings will turn into error. Therefore, it is
        wise to heed to those warnings and update the code to address
        the issue in order to avoid breaking the code in the future.</p>

      <h3>4.3 Tests build trust.</h3>
      <p>While we were able to run the executable in a modern
      machine, it was not possible to verify if the software was
      operating in the way expected by the authors in 2005. We also
      noticed a minor difference in the observed output and expected
        output (as documented in the reference manual).</p>
      <pre class="output">
## 2022 (output obtained using modern hardware and software libraries)
...
Removing faces... 479 faces removed... Done.
...

## 2005
...
Removing faces... 480 faces removed... Done.
...
</pre>

      <p>This discrepancy in the output makes one wonder if there is
        something amiss in the software code or the dependency
        library. This situation could have been avoided, to some extent,
        by including a set of self-contained and automated tests which
        would have helped the user to narrow down the issue. This
        discrepany has revealed the contribution of a software test
        suite in building trust with its users.</p>

      <h3>4.4 Code will run faster in future machines.</h3>
      <p>Reproducing the results reported by Nehab et al. (2005)
      revealed that the code ran 45 times faster in a modern hardware
        and software platform.</p>
      <pre class="output">
## 2022 (output obtained using a modern hardware and software libraries)
...
Smoothing normals... Done.  Filtering took 0.062695 sec.
...

## 2005
...
Smoothing normals... Done.  Filtering took 2.496497 sec.
...
      </pre>

      <p>This observation suggests that code execution will be faster
        in future platforms just because of improvements in hardware and
        software libraries. It also encourages developers to resist the
        temptation to optimise their code in order to save a few CPU
        cycles during execution. Such optimised code are often difficult
        to understand, maintain and fix. Therefore, it is wiser to write
        code that are easier to understand and runs at acceptable speed
        as compared to highly optimised code that runs faster but is
        difficult to understand and maintain.</p>

      <h3>4.5 Code and Documentation Should be Co-located.</h3>
      <p>The downloaded archive file contains a C++ source code, an
        executable file and some sample data. I missed a readme.txt file
        in the archive which usually provides details about compiling
        the source code, running the executable, expected output,
        description of the provided sample data, etc. After some
        exploration,
        the <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/NehEtAl05/reference.html">reference
          manual</a> page and <a href="https://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/NehEtAl05/examples.html">examples page</a> were
        discovered online. These pages are well written and proved
        extremely useful in understanding the process of reproducing
        the results reported in the paper. It would have been easier to
        locate if these HTML documents were included inside
        a <code>doc</code> folder of the downloaded archive file. In
        retrospect, the main website of Nehab et al. (2005) clearly
        shows a documentation section containing links to the
        reference manual and examples. For some reason, I downloaded
        the source and started to look inside the archive for the
        required documentation.</p>

      <h3>4.6 Code and documentation of Nehab et al. (2005) is
        intelligible and maintainable.</h3>
      <p>The code and documentation of Nehab et al. (2005) was easy
      to understand, interesting to read and easy to fix. It was
      remarkable to see a code written 17 years ago becoming alive and
      running 45 times faster in a modern hardware and software
      platform. The reference manual and examples page are clear and
      easy to understand. The source code is well documentation and
        intelligible.</p>
