      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>This article describes compilation and testing
        of a historical software release of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>
        database engine on a modern hardware and software
        platform. The goal is to learn the software engineering
        principles that emerge from the issues encountered during
        resurrection of a well maintained and widely adopted open
        source software. This learning exercise, called software
        resurrection, has been introduced in
        the REDACTED-FOR-PEER-REVIEW.</p>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>Software resurrection exercise begins with
          compilation of an old release of a well maintained and widely used
          software in a modern hardware and software platform. After
          successful compilation, the software's functionality is verified
          using automated suite of tests included with the release. Learning
          opportunities are provided by failure in compilation and testing
          processes. Learners engage with the program code and documentation
          to develop a fix for these issues. Finally, the exercise concludes
          by writing a critique of the software code and documentation which
          provides the opportunity to reflect on the experiences of
          compiling and testing the software in a modern
          platform.</figcaption>

      <p>The SQLite database engine has been selected for
        software resurrection because of the following reasons.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Long History</dt>
        <dd>The SQLite software has a long history (of more than 20
          years) of being actively developed and maintained. Software
          issues related to maintainability of a software show up only
          when we look at longer time scales (e.g. a span of 20 years). A software
          released only few years ago (e.g. 3 years ago) is most
          likely to compile successfully in a modern platform because
          the hardware and software dependencies do not introduce
          breaking changes in such a short span of time. Therefore,
          old releases of SQLite are suitable for the software
          resurrection exercise.</dd>

        <dt>Version Controlled History</dt>
        <dd>The SQLite software project maintains a <a target="_blank"
                                                       href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/README.md">publicly
            accessible Version Control System (VCS) history</a> of all
          code revisions since 29th May 2000. For example, the VCS
          <a target="_blank"
             href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/61c38f3bfef430f3">checkout</a>
          (or commit) and <a target="_blank"
                             href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/tree?ci=61c38f3bfef430f3">source
            code distribution</a> for sqlite-2.2.1 are publicly
          accessible in a online format and are available to
          download for offline use as well. Since SQLite has been
          actively developed and maintained, its version controlled
          history is highly likely to contain a fix for the issues
          encountered during software resurrection of
          sqlite-2002. If the learner is unable to develop a fix
          for an issue, the learner will explore different source
          of information (e.g. web search, documentation, etc.) to
          obtain a fix. The version control history is also a
          possible source of ideas for a fix or may even contain
          the fix in a form that is easy to borrow.</dd>

        <dt>Self Contained Tests</dt>
        <dd>The self contained test suite included with the old
          releases of SQLite allows us to verify the functionality of
          the sqlite software in a modern platform. Such tests are
          essential to assure the learner that the fixes applied to
          compile the software in a modern platform has not changed the
          behaviour of the software.</dd>

        <dt>Familiarity with the Programming Language</dt>
        <dd>SQLite is developed using the C programming language. The
          author of this article is familiar with the C programming
          language and therefore this software can be resurrected by the
          author of this article.</dd>
      </dl>


      <p>We pursue software resurrection exercise on the sqlite-2.2.1
        (<a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/61c38f3bfef430f3">VCS
          checkout</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="">source distribution</a>) version
        which was released on 9th January 2002 (more than 20 years
        ago). We use the keywords <strong>sqlite-2002</strong>
        throughout this article to refer to
        <a target="_blank"
           href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/61c38f3bfef430f3">sqlite-2.2.1</a>.
        This software release version is no longer maintained and
        is not recommended for use in production system. However,
        this article will show that sqlite-2002 is a valuable
        resource for learning and that it may contribute growth in
        wisdom of the learner. We use the following hardware and
        software environment for software resurrection exercise of
        sqlite-2002.</p>

      <p>In the <a href="compile.html">next section</a>, we begin the
        software resurrection process by compiling the sqlite-2002
        database engine on a modern hardware and software platform. All
        the steps described in this tutorial can be reproduced by
        executing a single script as follows.</p>
      <h4>Patch sqlite-2.2.1 released in 2002 such that it compiles
        in a modern hardware and software platform.</h4>
      <pre class="code">
mkdir -p $HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/
cd $HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/
wget https://sr.github.io/exercise/sqlite/2.2.1/patches.zip
unzip patches.zip
cd patches

## the apply-patch.sh script does the following
## 1. downloads sqlite-2.2.1 source
## 2. applies patches
## 3. builds sqlite and executes regression tests
./apply-patch.sh $HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/sqlite/
