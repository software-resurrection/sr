    <section id="sqlite:2.2.1:Compile">
      <h2>2. Compile</h2>
      <p>First, we download the sqlite-2002 (i.e. <a target="_blank"
                                                     href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/61c38f3bfef430f3">sqlite-2.2.1</a>
        release) sources. We will use the following folder in
        user&apos;s home folder to store all the files related to this
        exercise: <code>$HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/</code>.</p>
      <pre class="cmd">
## Download source for sqlite-2.2.1
mkdir -p $HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/
cd $HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/
wget https://www.sqlite.org/src/tarball/61c38f3b/SQLite-61c38f3b.tar.gz
tar -zxvf SQLite-61c38f3b.tar.gz
mv SQLite-61c38f3b sqlite
      </pre>

      <p>Next, we look for instructions to compile the source code in
        Unix like platform. Such instructions are commonly included in
        a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/file?name=README&ci=61c38f3bfef430f3">README</a>
        file contained within the source distribution.</p>
      <pre class="output">
<span class="cmd">$ cat sqlite/README</span>
This directory contains source code to

    SQLite: An SQL Database Engine in a C Library
...
   tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz    ;#  Unpack the source tree into "sqlite"
    mkdir bld                ;#  Build will occur in a sibling directory
    cd bld                   ;#  Change to the build directory
    ../sqlite/configure      ;#  Run the configure script
    make                     ;#  Run the makefile.
...
      </pre>

      <p>Recall that the compilation instructions were prepared in the
        year 2002 and at that time the developers of SQLite could not
        have seen how hardware and software platforms would change in 20
        years. Still, the compilation instructions looks familiar to a
        reader in the year 2022. We start the compilation process as
        advised by the SQLite developers.</p>

      <pre class="cmd">
## Build sqlite-2.2.1
cd $HOME/sr/sqlite/2.2.1/
mkdir build
cd build
../sqlite/configure
        </pre>
      <p>All the above commands successfully execute to
        completion. In the next section, we execute the build
        process using the <code>make</code> command and get a
        glimpse of our first issue.</p>

      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Compile:Issue-Section-2.1">2.1 Compiler Support Dropped for &lt;varargs.h&gt;</h3>
      <p>The sqlite-2002 software can be built using the GCC
        compiler by executing the <code>make</code> as follows.</p>

      <p>sqlite-2002 does not compile in gcc-10.2.1 (2021) and
        autoconf 2.69 (2012) because <code>tool/lemon.c</code>
        uses <code>varargs.h</code> which was deprecated by the gcc
        compiler since 4.0 (2005) release. How would we fix this
        compilation issue? Learners will be able to go through the
        experience of true self learning &mdash; which may lead to
        some profound insights, for example, about atomic version
        control commits &mdash; if they work to find a solution to
        this issue on their own. Clicking the &quot;Issue 1:
        ...&quot; box below will first reveal a tip which may help
        arrive at the solution.</p>

              support</a> for <code>varargs.h</code> since April 2004
            and switched to supporting <code>stdarg.h</code> to
            provide the same functionality, the sqlite developers
            must have adapted their code before the compilers
            implemented this breaking change.</p>

          <summary>Fix for Issue 2.1</summary>
          <p>The <code>vararg</code> issue was fixed only in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/590f963b6599e4e2">sqlite-2.8.1</a>
            release by replacing dependence on <code>varargs.h</code>
            with
            <code>stdarg.h</code>. Unfortunately, a fix for this issue
            did not appear in a single commit and therefore we had to
            selectively we borrow code updates for
            <code>tool/lemon.c</code>
            from <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/590f963b6599e4e2">sqlite-2.8.1</a>

        <aside id="sqlite:2.2.1:Compile:Issue-2.2:Tip">
          <h4>Tip</h4>
          <p>If the <code>getline()</code> method were a part of the
            standard library, the authors of sqlite-2.2.1 would have
            renamed their version of <code>getline()</code> before the
            release to avoid such conflicts. The standard library must
            have been updated after the release of sqlite-2.2.1
            (i.e. after Jan. 2002). Therefore, one of the commits (or
            checkouts) in the version control system history of SQLite
            may contain a fix for this issue as the SQLite software
            would have adapted to this change in the standards. Which
            keywords will you use
            in your <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/search?y=c">search</a>

            that resolved the name conflict. The conflict resolution
            (see <a target="_blank"
