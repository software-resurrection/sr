      <h2>4. Critique</h2>

      <p>We compiled and tested a version of the SQLite database
        engine that was released in the year 2002 (i.e. more than 20
        years ago). We encountered several issues during this
        exercise. Developing a fix for these issues provided valuable
        insight into the factors that contribute to intelligibility
        and maintainability of a program code and its
        documentation. To reflect of these experiences, we write
        a <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/critique_1?q=critique">critique</a>
        for the sqlite-2.2.1 release in the spirit similar
        to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism">literary
          criticism</a> where is purpose is not negative but the pursuit
        has higher goals of studying, evaluating, interpreting a
        literary piece like poem, story, essay, etc. In a similar
        spirit, our goal with this critique is to study, evaluate and
        interpret the program code and documentation associated with
        sqlite-2.2.1 which was released more than 20 years ago.</p>

      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Section:Critique:Section-4.1">4.1 Change is the only constant in a software.</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Everything changes and nothing stands still.
        <span class="quote_source">Heraclitus (a Greek philosopher)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>A software tool lives and thrives in an ecosystem created by
        hardware (e.g. CPU, memory, etc.), operating system and dependent
        software libraries. This ecosystem is continually changing in order to
        address the requirements of the changing world. Therefore, change is
        the only constant also in the life of a software. It is wiser to
        accept and embrace the fact that changes to a software will be
        necessary as it moves forward in time.</p>

      <p>A class of updates in a software that will prevent normal operation of
        other software tools or services that depends on the software is
        called a <i>breaking change</i>. While nobody wants to commit such
        breaking changes, they are sometimes essential. The
        <a href="compile.html#sqlite:2.2.1:Compile:Issue-Section-2.1">Issue
          2.1</a> has revealed that it is important to have flags or
        markers that caution the users of such breaking changes at the
        point of usage. The GCC compiler developers have wisely chosen
        to include a <code>varargs.h</code> file in all GCC compiler
        distributions -- since 2004 -- which produces an informative
        error message when the compiler attempts to use the unsupported
        <code>varargs.h</code> header file. Such wise decisions has and
        will help many software maintainers in the future.</p>

      <h4>File: /usr/lib/gcc/.../include/varargs.h</h4>
      <pre class="code">
#ifndef _VARARGS_H
#define _VARARGS_H

#error "GCC no longer implements &lt;varargs.h&gt;."
#error "Revise your code to use &lt;stdarg.h&gt;."

#endif
      </pre>

      <p>Posting critical information at the point of usage is an important
        construct for introducing a breaking change. In the case of compilers,
        this involves showing an informative error message when a user tries
        to access an unsupported feature. Further details about a breaking
        change can also be disseminated through other forms of communication
        like mailing list, software release document, etc. For example, the
        GCC compiler release document contains a clear and concise notice
        about this breaking change.</p>
      <blockquote>
        GCC no longer ships <code>&lt;varargs.h&gt;</code>. Use
        <code>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</code> instead.
        <span class="quote_source"><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/changes.html">GCC
        3.4 Release Series</a>
        </span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The developers of the Tcl library could not provide information about
        a breaking change at the point of usage. To find a fix for
        <a href="test.html#sqlite:2.2.1:Test:Issue-Section-3.1">Issue
        3.1</a>, a maintainer has to explore the software
        documentation. A more intelligible compiler error message suggesting a
        corrective action would have been more useful. For example, a software
        trying to access the <code>result</code> field of the <code>Tcl_Interp</code>
        data structure should be informed with an error message that this
        feature is no longer available without defining the macro
        <code>USE_INTERP_RESULT</code>. The GCC compiler permits, for example,
        the <code>deprecated</code> attribute for a function to show a warning if
        the an unsupported function gets used. However, such a feature is not
        available for data member access and is the reason, most likely, why
        such informative warnings were not generated when the <code>result</code>
        field of the <code>Tcl_Interp</code> data structure was accessed.</p>

    <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.2">4.2 To depend or not to depend, is a profound question that the wise can answer.</h3>
      <p>The SQLite developers chose to rely on a non-standard feature
      (i.e. <code>vararg.h</code>) provided by the compilers of their
      time (i.e. year
      2002). The <a href="compile.html#sqlite:2.2.1:Compile:Issue-Section:2.1">Issue
      2.1</a> revealed that dependence on non-standard features makes
      the software vulnerable to changes in ecosystem thereby
      increasing maintenance costs.</p>

      <p><a href="test.html#sqlite:2.2.1:Test:Issue-Section-3.1">Issue
      3.1</a> revealed another fact about software dependencies; if
      software A depends on a software library B then it implies that
      A has accepted that its fate is tied with the fate of B. The
      SQLite software uses the TCL library to implement its test
      suite. One can understand the benefit of this dependence; it
      allows the SQLite developers to easily write tests in the Tcl
      language which is more concise, clear and easier to
      maintain. The cost of such dependence is often overshadowed by
      the benefits. This dependency required the SQLite software to
      act whenever the Tcl library introduces any breaking
      changes.</p>

      <p>"To depend or not to depend is the question my dear
      developers", would have asked Shakespeare if he were reflecting
      on the pros and cons of software dependencies. All dependencies
      have a cost and understanding the cost is the first step in
      taking a wise decision on whether to depend on a third party
      library or to develop your own functionality. A wise developer
      will look at the benefits and costs of a software dependency
      with certain degree of impartiality in order to truly evaluate
      the impact of such dependencies.</p>

      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.3">4.3 Unitary (or atomic) revisions to a version control system
        are more useful.</h3>
      <p>Software developers often use a Version Control System (VCS) to
        keep a historical record of changes (or, revisions) being made to a
        software. Such historical record of revisions not only helps
        understand the growth of a software and its structure but also allows
        changes to be removed with surgical precision when the software
        behaves in undesirable ways. It is easier to understand and reason
        about a revision that introduces only one conceptual change (e.g. a
        feature, a bug fix, a new test case, etc.) in a software. Such
        revisions can be said to be unitary (or atomic) as they reflect a unit
        of change in the software.</p>

      <p>The value of unitary revisions were realised while fixing the
        <a href="compile.html#sqlite:2.2.1:Compile:Issue-Section-2.2">Issue
          2.2</a>. The <code>getline()</code> identifier name conflict with the
        standard library was fixed as
        a <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/vpatch?from=93a2c961b17d2459&to=558969ee8697180c">single
          revision</a> in the version control history of the SQLite. This
        revision contained relevant keywords (e.g. <code>getline</code>) in the
        revision log message that made it easier to locate. Such a unitary
        revision was not available
        for <a href="compile.html#sqlite-2.2.1:Compile:Issue-Section-2.1">Issue
          2.1</a> whose fix was more difficult to develop as the fix required
        manually selecting code updates from one of
        the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/590f963b6599e4e2">future
          revisions</a>. Therefore, unitary (or atomic) revisions with a
        revision log containing all the relevant keywords are useful. When
        deciding about the keywords relevant for a revision, it helps to think
        about a learner who is allowed to search the revision log history
        using only one or two keywords.</p>

      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.4">4.4 Global Identifier Names
        Should be both Unique and Intelligible</h3>
      <p>The developers of sqlite-2002 came up with the <code>getline()</code>
        method name well before the method was defined in the standard library
        through the <code><stdio.h></code> header file. They fixed this name
        conflict by renaming the method to <code>local_getline()</code> which not
        only avoided conflict with the <code>getline()</code> method in the
        standard library but also avoided any future conflicts with other
        software. This was a wise decision because the updated method name has
        survived more than 20 years of change in compilers and standard
        libraries.</p>

      <p>In some programming languages, like the C programming language, the
        identifier names (e.g. function names, variable names, etc.) are
        stored in either global or local scope. Names stored in the global
        scope (e.g. function names such as <code>getline()</code>) are accessible
        to all parts of the program and therefore have greater chance of
        conflicting with other parts of the software (e.g. standard
        library). Identifiers in the local scope (e.g. variable names defined
        within a function) are only accessible in that local scope and
        therefore has smaller chance of conflict with other identifiers
        defined in that scope. Here is an example, taken from the SQLite code,
        showing identifiers in both global and local scope.</p>

      <h4>File: sqlite/src/shell.c</h4>
      <pre class="code">
static char *getline(char *zPrompt, FILE *in){
  char *zLine;
  int nLine;
  ...
}
      </pre>

      <p>In the above code snippet, the function name <code>getline()</code> is
        stored in the global scope and therefore it can be invoked from any
        part of the program including the local scope of any other
        function. On the other hand, the variable <code>zPrompt</code>,
        <code>in</code>, <code>zLine</code>, <code>nLine</code> are
        stored in the local scope of the <code>getline()</code> function and
        therefore these variables are only accessible from within
        the <code>getline()</code> function.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="img/intelligible-and-unique-global-identifiers.png">
        <figcaption>Identifier names (e.g. function name, variable name, etc.)
          in the global scope should be both unique and intelligible. Only
          unique or only intelligible identifier names are less
          useful.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Programmers have to deal with the following two conflicting
        requirements when crafting the identifier names that have to live in
        the global scope.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Uniqueness</i> : The identifier names must to be unique so
          that it does not conflict with identifiers that are currently
          defined and the identifiers that will get defined in the future in
          other parts of the software (e.g. standard library, dependent
          libraries, etc.). So the challenge for the programmer is to think of
          an identifier name that cannot be possibly thought by anyone else.</li>
        <li><i>Intelligibility</i> : The identifier names should be
          intelligible in order to convey the purpose of that identifier to
          the reader. The more informative an identifier name is, the more
          useful it is to the reader.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>If one chooses a fairly unique name (e.g. f531e2ca26a5) then it is
        unlikely that this identifier name will ever conflict with any other
        identifiers. However, such identifier names will not be intelligible
        to the readers as it does not convey any meaning. On the other hand,
        one can chose a highly intelligible identifier name
        (e.g. <code>getline()</code>) that fully conveys the purpose of the
        method. However, such an intelligible name would also invite conflict
        as it is highly likely that others will also want to use such an
        intelligible name for a function that has a similar
        purpose. Therefore, one has to chose an identifier name that lives in
        the global scope by carefully balancing the uniqueness and
        intelligibility requirements. The developers of SQLite chose such a
        balance by adding the prefix <code>local</code> to the method name.</p>

      <p>Many programming languages have introduced the concept of namespace to
        compartmentalise global identifier names into buckets (or, namespace)
        such that these identifiers can only be accessed using the name of the
        bucket. For example, in the C++ programming language the
        <code>getline()</code> method defined by the standard library would be
        placed in the std namespace and be accessed using
        <code>std::getline()</code> identifier name. The getline() function
        defined by the SQLite database engine would be placed in the sqlite
        namespace, for example, and would be accessed using
        <code>sqlite::getline()</code> identifier name. One could argue that this
        is similar to the practice of adding a prefix (or suffix) to an
        identifier name in order to avoid conflicts. This is a valid
        argument. However, a feature provided by the compiler makes the
        concept of namespace more useful in reducing conflict and improving
        intelligibility. Namespaces have a scope and if an identifier is used
        within a namespace, then one can remove namespace name prefix from the
        identifier name. The default compiler behaviour is to assume that all
        identifier names without the namespace prefix correspond to the
        current namespace. This feature helps to improve intelligibility while
        maintaining uniqueness. However, the reader is required to be aware of
        the current namespace in order to correctly resolve an identifier
        name.</p>


      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.5">4.5 Tests build trust</h3>
      <p>The SQLite database engine was ready to use after the successful
        compilation of the sqlite-2002 as described in
        <a href="compile.html#sqlite:2.2.1:Section:Compile">Compile
          section</a>. One could create some tables, insert some sample
        data, search for an entry and delete those entries to confirm
        that the database engine is functioning properly even after 20
        years of its release. While these mock tests allow verification
        of the basic functionality of the software, it is not sufficient
        to build trust in the software. In other words, the ad hoc and
        mock tests cannot convince someone to use this software for
        storing and managing critical information like financial or
        medical data. One requires more stronger guarantees which can
        only be provided by automated and self contained tests that can
        be run by the users in their own machines. The developers of the
        sqlite-2002 are best placed to build such automated tests
        because they can reasonably be expected to quantify the desired
        behaviour of the software. Such suite of software tests are
        essential to build trust between the user and the software. The
        sqlite-2002 software contains such a self contained suite of
        tests and therefore allows its users to build such a trust even
        after 20 years of its release.</p>

      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.6">4.6 Tests define the
        expected behaviour of a software.</h3>
      <p>Successful compilation of a 20 year old software (i.e. sqlite-2002) on
        a modern platform brought happiness and a sense of
        achievement. However, these feelings were quickly overshadowed by
        doubts as it became clear that the sqlite-2002 software was not
        designed to run on future platforms; the developers of SQLite could
        not be foreseen how the hardware and software would change in 20
        years. Therefore, although the software compiled successfully in a
        modern platform, it was not known if the software can function in the
        way that its developers had expected during its released in the year
        2002. Is it possible to concretely define the behaviour of a software
        as it was desired in the year 2002?</p>

      <p>The sqlite-2002 documentation states that this version of
        sqlite, "implements a large subset of SQL92." and allows
        "atomic commit and rollback protect data integrity". It is
        possible to prepare some SQL query statements based on the
        SQL92 standard and prepare some SQL tables to test atomic
        commits. However, will these be sufficient to confirm that the
        software is truly behaving in the way it was designed to
        behave before its release in the year 2002? The developers of
        sqlite-2002 were best placed to know the desired and expected
        behaviour of this version of SQLite. One could write hundreds
        of pages of documents or use formal software verification
        methods to describe the expected behaviour of a software. The
        software resurrection exercise has highlighted the role of
        automated and self-contained tests in allowing one to quickly
        and easily verify the functionality of a software. These tests
        not only verify functionality of a software on a new platform
        but also act as a concrete specification of the correct
        behaviour of a software. Such tests are also useful for
        developing an understanding of the input and output
        characteristics of a software.</p>


      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.7">4.7 Who tests the
        Test?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        But who will guard the guardians themselves?
        <span class="quote_source">Juvenal (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Juvenal">Satire VI</a>)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p>An automated and self contained test suite is a program code
        that has been designed to test a software. The test suite invokes
        various features of the software with a set of test inputs and
        compares it against a set of corresponding expected outputs. If there
        is a mismatch, the test suite shows a failure message that informs
        about an unexpected behaviour in the software. The testing process
        relies on the assumption that the test suite is operating
        correctly.</p>

      <p>The sqlite-2002 test suite crashed with a SEGFAULT error while running
        the <code>btree-1.1</code> test case. An investigation revealed the test
        suite architecture as shown in figure below. The test cases (e.g.
        <code>btree-1.1</code>) in sqlite-2002 are defined using the Tcl
        programming language (\eg <code>test/btree.test</code>). The core SQLite
        database engine is defined using the C programming language (e.g.
        <code>src/btree.c</code>). A test driver layer contains a set of functions
        (\eg <code>btree_open</code> defined in <code>src/test{1,2,3}.c</code>)
        that allows the Tcl based test specifications to access functionality
        of the core SQLite database
        engine. The figure shown below illustrates the control
        and data flow for the test case <code>btree-1.1</code> whose purpose is to
        verify the sqlite engine's ability to create a new database and
        represent it using a btree data structure stored in a disk file. The
        coordination between the test specification code and the test driver
        layer relies on correctly exchanging the pointer address of the
        database. An arduous and often frustrating debugging process revealed
        that this exchange of pointer address was failing because the test
        driver layer assumed that memory addresses were 32 bits long. Such an
        assumption broke most of the test code because the driver layer
        wrongly translated 64 bit pointer addresses (e.g.
        <code>0x5555555e3db0</code>) to 32 bit pointer addresses (e.g.
        <code>0x555e3db0</code>) by dropping the higher 32 bits portion of the
        address. This resulted in the segmentation fault error.</p>

          executions in sqlite-2002. The test specifications are defined in
          the Tcl scripting language. The sqlite core database engine uses
          the C programming language. A driver layer exposes the
          functionality of the sqlite core database engine library which
          exposes different functionality of the core sqlite database engine
          as Tcl commands.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The software resurrection exercise on sqlite-2002 has shown
        that if a test suite has complex logic and involves
        substantial program code then the test suite merits a testing
        process for itself to ensure that the test code does not have
        any flaws. This leads to a recursive testing dependency in
        which a test suite a test for itself in order to assure that
        the test suite is functioning correctly. Such a requirement
        can be avoided by a test suite that is so simple that it does
        not demand a test for itself. For example, a test suite which
        requires an elaborate setup and complex exchanges of data
        between the test suite and the software is highly likely to
        fail in its duty of reliably testing the software. On the
        other hand, a test suite that simply instantiates an object
        and triggers a method of the object is less likely to
        fail. The test control and data flow process shown in figure
        above must have its merits and therefore was chosen by the
        sqlite-2002 developers. However, the issues encountered while
        testing the sqlite-2002 on a modern platform did highlight the
        need for tests that have minimal setup and simple logic. Only
        such simple test suites are capable of providing assurances
        that any failure in the testing process can be solely
        attributed to the software that is being tested and does not
        correspond to an issue caused by the test code itself.</p>

        <figcaption>If the program code for testing a software is complex, then
          it demands a test for itself. A test suite is useful only when it
          is simple to operate and therefore does not merit a test

      <h3 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:Section-4.8">4.8 SQLite-2002 is an
        intelligible and maintainable software</h3>
      <p>The SQLite database engine that was released 20 years ago can
        be compiled in a modern hardware and software platform. It also
        delivers all the features included in the original software release as
        evidenced by successful execution of the regression tests. The program
        code and regression tests required corrective software maintenance in
        order to address the changes in the hardware and software
        libraries. These maintenance activities could be performed by a modern
        day developer because the program code is well documented. A
        <code>README</code> text file provides an inviting introduction to the
        software. Every function definition in the source code includes a
        clear and concise description of its purpose. The user defined data
        types are intelligible because of their identifier names as well as
        the comments accompanying them. The software's architecture and
        purpose of its various components are also well documented in a set of
        self contained and static and offline HTML files that are generated by
        the autoconf's <code>make doc</code> command. These documents and
        comments, written 20 years ago, communicates to a modern day developer
        with remarkable effectiveness and clarity. The sqlite-2002 software is
        therefore an intelligible and maintainable software that is equally
        valuable for learning some of the software engineering principles.</p>

      <h2 id="sqlite:2.2.1:Critique:writing-critique">Writing Critique of a Resurrected Software</h2>
      <p>The issues encountered during compilation and testing
      activities of the software resurrection exercise provides a
      thread of investigation around which one can write a critique. I
      have found the following thought experiment helpful for writing
      the critique of a historical release of the SQLite software.</p>

      <p>I imagined that I am writing an email
        to <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?u=drh&c=2002-01-09">drh</a>
        that gets delivered soon after the sqlite-2.2.1 version is
        released. This email will be sent from the future and gets
        delivered
        to <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?u=drh&c=2002-01-09">drh</a>
        right after he pushes the sqlite-2.2.1 release to a FTP server
        as illustrated below.</p>

        <figcaption>As <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?u=drh&c=2002-01-09">drh</a>
          released sqlite version 2.2.1 on 9th January 2002 in a
          parallel universe separate from ours, he received an email
          from the future. Will he retract his release to reflect
          about the points raised in the email? Will the release date
          of 2.2.1 be pushed into the future? Moreover, what will
          sqlite look like after 20 years in this parallel universe
          that can receive emails from the future?</figcaption>
